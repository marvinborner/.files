# .files
These are my personal dotfiles of my main PC and all my other devices. You probably shouldn't use these, as the configs are **very** specific to my PC usage.

## My routine for new machines
1. Clone this repository and move all its files into your `$HOME` (including `.git`)
2. Execute `./sync`
3. Repeat step 2 every once in a while
